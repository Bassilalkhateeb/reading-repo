# A summary of HTML and CSS


### Ch 1
#### Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag example : * <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1> 
### Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.example * The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code.The closing </html> tag indicates that it is the end of the HTML code.
### <p> is an opening tagThe characters in the brackets indicate the tag's purpose. For example, in the tags above the p stands for paragraph. </p> is a closing tag
### Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign. example <p lang="en-us"> lang : Attribute Name "en-us" Attribute Value Here an attribute called lang is used to indicate the language used in this element. The value of this attribute on this page specifies it is in US English.
