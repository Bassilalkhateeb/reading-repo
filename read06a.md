# JavaScript: Functions, methods, and objects


### Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.
### WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
### the statements in a function are not always executed when a page loads, so functions also offer a way to store the steps needed to achieve a task. The script can then ask the function to perform all of those steps as and when they are required.
### If you are going to ask the function to perform its task later, you need to give your function a name. That name should describe the task it is performing. When you ask it to perform its task, it is known as calling the function.
### Parameters : Pieces of information passed to a function.
### When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is 
### known as a return value.
### Declaring a function
### Function  sayhello() {
### Document.write(‘hello’);
### }
### Function : function keyword
### sayhello() : function name
### { Document.write(‘hello’);} : (between curly braces) code block
### Calling functions (duckett book js page 91)
### Declaring a function that needs information (duckett book js page 92)
### Calling a function that needs information and the difference between arguments , parameters and values (duckett book js page 93)
### Getting a single and multiple values out of a function (page 94 & 95)
