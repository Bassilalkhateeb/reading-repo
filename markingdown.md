## Reading about markdown and Github got me some knowledge about it  :
### Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
* ### You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:
### •	Gists.
### •	Comments in Issues and Pull Requests.
### •	Files with the .md or .markdown extension.
### also there is a syntax guide of how to use markdown.
## *Github* : 
### The best definition that could tell what is Github , GitHub is an online service where programmers can store their code… think of it as a cloud service for programmers… it is even possible to publish a complete website using GitHub...
### Also there is a guide of writing and formatting on GitHub , It's usefull.
