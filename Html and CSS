## A summury of Html and CSS
###Ch 1 
#### *Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag
example : <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.
example The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code.The closing </html> tag indicates that it is the end of the HTML code.
3 < p> is an opening tagThe characters in the brackets
indicate the tag's purpose.
For example, in the tags above
the p stands for paragraph.
</p> is a closing tag
4 Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign. 
example <p lang="en-us">
lang : Attribute
Name "en-us" Attribute
Value
Here an attribute called lang is
used to indicate the language
used in this element. The value
of this attribute on this page
specifies it is in US English.
5 To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.
Ch 17 
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements , such as :
divide
Headers & Footers
Navigation
The new elements provide clearer code Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
X To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
